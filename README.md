It's important to mention that this is an ever-evolving repository, where the tasks presented may not be complete yet. However, work in progress will continue to be added over time. 
Also, there are various approaches and comments highlighting what was done and assumed.

## Skills & Techniques Used:

### **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning**
- Handling missing values (imputation, removal, interpolation)  
- Correcting inconsistent string values & data types  
- Feature engineering (creating new columns, transforming variables)  
- Handling outliers & scaling numerical features  
- Working (and creating) with datetime features for time series analysis  

### **SQL & Database Management**
- Writing queries (joins, window functions, aggregations, common table expressions, stored procedures, transactions, and string manipulations) 

### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualizing distributions, correlations, and trends  
- Generating insights through graphs and statistical summaries  
- Detecting patterns & anomalies in data  

### **Machine Learning Models**
- **Supervised Learning**: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, KNN, Neural Networks  
- **Unsupervised Learning**: K-Means Clustering, PCA for dimensionality reduction  
- **Time Series Forecasting**: ARIMA, SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing
